Feasibility study

The feasibility study is the important step in any software development process. This is because
it makes analysis of different aspects like - cost required for developing and executing the
system, the time required for each phase of the system and so on. If these important factors
are not analyzed then definitely it would have impact on the organization &amp; the development
and the system would be a total failure.

The purpose of feasibility study is not to solve the problem, but to determine whether 
the problem is worth solving. By making analysis this way it would be possible to make a
report of identified area of problem. By making a detailed analysis in this area a detailed
document or report is prepared in this phase which has details like project plan or schedule of
the project, the cost estimated for developing and executing the system, target dates for each
phase of delivery of system developed and so on. This phase is the base of software
development process since further steps taken in software development life cycle would be
based on the analysis made on this phase and so careful analysis has to be made in this phase.

The feasibility study concentrates on the following area (TELOS):
. Technology and system feasibility
. Economic feasibility
. Legal feasibility
. Operational feasibility
. Schedule feasibility

Technology and system feasibility

The assessment is based on an outline design of system requirements, to determine whether
the company has the technical expertise to handle completion of the project.
Economic feasibility (Cost/Benefit Analysis)

The economic feasibility study evaluates the cost of the software development against
the ultimate income or benefits expected from the developed system. It includes
identifying cost and benefit factors like - Development costs and Operating costs. There must
be scopes for profit after the successful completion of the project.

Legal feasibility

It determines whether the proposed system conflicts with legal requirements, e.g. a data
processing system must comply with the local Data Protection Acts.

Operational feasibility

Operational feasibility is a measure of how well a proposed system solves the problems, and
takes advantage of the opportunities identified during scope definition and how it satisfies the
requirements identified in the requirements analysis phase of system development.

Schedule feasibility

A project will fail if it takes too long to be completed before it is useful. Typically this means
estimating how long the system will take to develop, and if it can be completed in a given time
period using some methods like payback period. Schedule feasibility is a measure of how
reasonable the project timetable is. Given our technical expertise, are the project deadlines
reasonable?

Advantages of making Feasibility study:
. As the initial step of software development life cycle, feasibility study has all the analysis
part in it, which helps in analyzing the system requirements completely.
. Helps in identifying the risk factors involved in developing and deploying the system
. It helps in making cost/benefit analysis which helps the organization and system to run
efficiently.
. It is a report which could be used by the senior or top persons in the organization. This is
because, based on the report the organization decides about cost estimation, funding and
other important decisions which is very essential for an organization to run profitably and
for the system to run stable.

Software Development Life Cycle

The Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a conceptual model used in project management
that describes the stages involved in an information system development project from an initial
feasibility study through maintenance of the completed application.

The following are the activities of the SDLC
. Software requirement analysis
. Systems analysis and design
. Design/Code generation
. Testing
. Development and Maintenance

A Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) adheres to
important phases that are essential for developers, such as
planning, analysis, design, and implementation. A number of system development life cycle
(SDLC) models have been created such as waterfall, fountain, spiral etc.

Requirement Analysis/Investigation

The 1st stage of SDLC is the investigation phase. During this stage, business opportunities and
problems are identified, and information technology solutions are discussed. Multiple
alternative projects may be suggested and their feasibility analyzed. The results of the
feasibility study can then be compiled into a report, along with preliminary specifications. When
the investigation stage ends, a decision whether or not to move forward with the project
should be made.

System Analysis

The goal of system analysis is to determine where the problem is, in an attempt to fix the
system. It analyzes the requirement for the proposed system. To understand the nature of the
program to build, the system engineer must understand the information domain for the
software, as well as required functions, performance and the interfacing. This step involves
breaking down the system in different pieces to analyze the situation, analyzing project goals,
breaking down what needs to be created. From the available information the system engineer
develops a list of system level requirement for the project.

Design

Systems design describes screen layouts, business rules, process diagrams, a complete entity-
relationship diagram with a full data dictionary and other documentation. It defines specifically
how the software is to be written including an object model, the client/server technology, a
detailed database design etc. These design elements are intended to describe the software in
sufficient detail that skilled programmers may develop the software with minimal additional
input design. Analysis and design are very important in the whole development cycle. Any glitch
in the design could be very expensive to solve in the later stage of the software development.
The design must be translated into a machine readable form.

Testing

In this stage, all the pieces of software are brought together into a special testing environment
and then are checked for errors, bugs and interoperability. Unit, system and user acceptance
testing is often performed.

Deployment and Maintenance

Deployment is the final stage 
of initial development. It involves installation, initial training and
may involve hardware and network upgrades. Software will definitely undergo change once it is
delivered to the customer. There may be many reasons for the change. Change could be due to
some unexpected input values into the system. The software should be developed to
accommodate changes that could take place during the post implementation period.
Maintaining the system is also an important aspect of SDLC.
