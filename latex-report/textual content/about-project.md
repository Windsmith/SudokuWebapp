The aim of the project, Sudoku Webapp, is to provide an aesthetically rich interface for 
sudoku enthusiasts to enjoy sudoku puzzles. 

A website with 3 webpages: home page, sudoku page and leaderboard page, is the frontend
of the project with which the user interacts. The webpages are made using Django, HTML, CSS, Javascript
and a CSS framework called Tailwind. A mysql database acts as the backend and stores player's
name and their score and provides it to the leaderboard page to display.

A personal aim with this project was to see how much we, as a team, could push ourselves to 
make a good, functional service. It challenged our creativity, programming skills and our 
ability to work and co-operate as a team. This project was a great learning experience.
