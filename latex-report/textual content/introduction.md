Python was created in the late 1980s, and first released in 1991,
by Guido van Rossum as a successor to the ABC programming language.

Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.
Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding,
make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting
or glue language to connect existing components together. 

Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of
program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.
The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form 
without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

Features in Python

1. Easy to code:
Python is a high-level programming language. 
   Python is very easy to learn the language as compared to other languages like C, C#, Javascript,
   Java, etc. It is very easy to code in python language and anybody can learn python basics
   in a few hours or days. It is also a developer-friendly language.

2. Free and Open Source:
Since it is open-source, this means that source code is also available to the public.
So you can download it as, use it as well as share it.

3. Object-Oriented Language:
One of the key features of python is Object-Oriented programming.
   Python supports object-oriented language and concepts of classes, objects encapsulation, etc.

4. High-Level Language:
Python is a high-level language. When we write programs in python,
   we do not need to remember the system architecture, nor do we need to manage the memory.

5. Extensible feature:
Python is a Extensible language.
   We can write us some Python code into C or C++ language and also we can compile
   that code in C/C++ language.

6. Python is Portable language:
Python language is also a portable language.
   For example, if we have python code for windows and if we want to run this code on
   other platforms such as Linux, Unix, and Mac then we do not need to change it,
   we can run this code on any platform.

7. Python is Integrated language:
Python is also an Integrated language because we can easily integrated python with other languages like 
   c, c++, etc.

8. Interpreted Language:
Python is an Interpreted Language because Python code is executed line by line at a time.
   like other languages C, C++, Java, etc. there is no need to compile python code this makes it
   easier to debug our code. The source code of python is converted into an immediate form called bytecode.

9. Large Standard Library
Python has a large standard library which provides a rich set of module and
   functions so you do not have to write your own code for every single thing.
   There are many libraries present in python for such as regular expressions, unit-testing, web browsers, etc.

10. Dynamically Typed Language:
Python is a dynamically-typed language. That means the type (for example- int, double, long, etc.) 
    for a variable is decided at run time not in advance because of this feature we donâ€™t need to 
    specify the type of variable.
